        "\n",
        "This script is designed to manage and analyze donation allocations for various projects and operational expenses in a charity. The primary functionalities of the script are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Importing Data**: The script imports CSV files containing information about donations and budgets for different projects and operational expenses. These files are read into pandas DataFrames for easy manipulation and analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Calculating Allocations**: The script calculates the portion of each donation that is allocated to project budgets and operational expenses based on predefined percentages.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Allocating Unlabeled Donations**: Unlabeled donations, which are donations not specifically earmarked for a particular project, are allocated to various project budgets. The script ensures that these donations are distributed appropriately based on the available budget and the size of the donations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Assigning Donations to Budget Posts**: The script matches donations to specific budget posts within each project. It ensures that the donations are allocated in a way that covers the costs of the budget items.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Handling Operational Expenses**: Donations are also allocated to operational expenses, which are costs that are necessary for the overall functioning of the charity but are not specific to a single project. The script ensures these expenses are appropriately covered by the donations.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Managing the War Chest**: Any remaining donations that are not allocated to project budgets or operational expenses are added to a \"war chest,\" which represents unallocated funds that can be used for future needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Generating Reports**: For each donation, the script can generate a detailed report showing how the donation was allocated. This includes the projects, categories, and specific budget items that the donation helped to fund."

        "\n",
        "2. **Section 2: Prepare Donations DataFrames**:\n",
        "    - This section calculates the amount of each donation that will be allocated to project budgets and operational expenses based on the operational expense percentage.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Section 3: Allocate Unlabeled Donations to Projects**:\n",
        "    - This function allocates unlabeled donations to project budgets by comparing the cumulative sum of donations with the cumulative sum of budget costs. It ensures that donations are distributed appropriately across different budget posts.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Section 4: Fill Budget Posts with Donations and Operational Expenses**:\n",
        "    - This function creates a DataFrame showing how donations are assigned to specific budget posts for a given project. It processes each project separately and generates lists of transaction IDs for each budget post.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Section 5: Handle War Chest**:\n",
        "    - This section calculates the remaining donations that were not allocated to any project or operational expense and assigns them to the war chest. The war chest represents unallocated funds.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Section 6: Function to Generate Donation Report**:\n",
        "    - This function generates a detailed report for a given transaction ID (`tx_id`). It checks where the donation was allocated, including project budgets and operational expenses, and summarizes the amounts transferred to the war chest, project budgets, and operational expenses.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **User Input Loop**:\n",
        "    - This loop continuously prompts the user for transaction IDs and generates reports for each provided transaction ID.\n",
